        <p>"My dearest Laiba,
            Every moment spent with you feels like a dream I never want to wake up from. Your presence fills my heart
            with a warmth I can’t quite explain, and your smile brightens even the darkest of days. You are my
            everything, the one who makes life so beautiful and full of love. I’m endlessly grateful to have you by my
            side, and I promise to cherish you forever. With all my heart, always."</p><br>
